From the dashboard, we can conclude that- 

Departure Delay is the reason causing maximum flight delay. Also, we can apply filter to see Airline-wise data of reasons for delay. 
Although, the  first reason is departure delay, the second highest contributor to delay changes. 
For Jet blue airways, it is arrival delay whereas for Delta airlines, second highest reason for delay is airline delay.

With the help of this analysis, travelers can make informed decisions while selecting flights and avoid cancellation of flight.

The first sheet gives insights into flight cancellation data wherein we can filter by state, month or weekdays.                                                  
The second sheet gives data on which airport has maximum/minimum number of cancellations on the same parameters chosen in sheet1.                              
Sheet 3 further drills down the data and finds which airlines have fewer number of cancellations. 

For example, if a person wants to travel in January on Monday from New York , insights the buyer will have –
•	New York has maximum cancellations among all states in January on Monday
•	If he selects bubble showing New York in sheet1, he gets further information that J.F.kennedy and LaGuardia airports have maximum cancellations and might want to board flight from Albany or greater Rochester airports that have fewer cancellations 
•	From sheet 3, he will further know which airlines has minimum cancellation. JetBlue Airways and American Airlines have highest cancellations while Virgin America, Southwest Airlines, Spirit Airlines and US Airways have minimum cancellations and can be preferred over those with higher cancellations.

Note: Although there are several factors which contribute to an individual’s choice of airline or airport, the above findings are 
      restricted to the analysis of cancellation data in this story.
